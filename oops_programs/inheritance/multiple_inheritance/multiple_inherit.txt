Multiple inheritance: In this type of inheritance, the child class is derived from multiple parent class.
                        the child class will have access to the attributes and functions of all the parent classes.



e.g.

class Prey:
    def flee(self):
        print("This animal can flee")

class Predator:
    def hunt(self):
        print("This animal can hunt")


class Rabbit(Prey):
    pass

class Lion(Predator):
    pass

class Fish(Prey, Predator):
    pass

rab1 = Rabbit()
print("Rabbit behaviour......")
rab1.flee()

lion1 = Lion()
print("Lion behaviour...........")
lion1.hunt()

fish1 = Fish()
print("Fish behaviour..........")
fish1.flee()
fish1.hunt()

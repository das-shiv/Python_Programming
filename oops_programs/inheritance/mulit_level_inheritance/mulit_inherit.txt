> Mulit level inheritance: Here a class is derived from another child class, which was derived from it's parent class.
                            the child class inherits the attributes and functions from it's parent class as well as parent class's parent class.




e.g.
class Oragnism:  #parent class
    alive = True


class Animal(Oragnism):  #Animal class is derived from Oragnism class, it is child class of Oragnism class and parent class of Dog class.
    def eat(self):
        print("This animal is eating")

class Dog(Animal):      #Dog class is derived from Animal class.
    def bark(self):
        print("This dog is barking")


dog1 = Dog()
print("Is this dog alive? ",dog1.alive)
dog1.eat()
dog1.bark()

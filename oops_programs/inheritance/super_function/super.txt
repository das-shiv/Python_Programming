super function: the super() function is used to call a method from a parent class to access the functionalities.
                it is often used while doing method overriding, we fetch the functionalities of parent class function using super() function
                and then add our own functionalities to it.



e.g.

class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

    def start(self):
        print(f"The {self.brand} is starting")


class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        super().__init__(brand)
        self.model = model

    def start(self):
        super().start()
        print(f"The {self.model} model of {self.brand} brand is staring")


car1 = Car("Tata","Nano")
car1.start()

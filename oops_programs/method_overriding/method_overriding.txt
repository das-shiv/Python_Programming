Method overriding: when a class is derived from another class, the child class inherits all the methods from parents class.
                    but we can create a method in child class with same name and arguments that's in parent class, and implement it in a
                    different way. this is called method overriding.



e.g.

class Animal:
    def eat(self):
        print("This animal is eating")


class Rabbit(Animal):
    def eat(self):
        print("This rabbit is eating")  #The eat method from Animal class is overriden in the Rabbit class.



rab1 = Rabbit()
rab1.eat()

lambda function: these are small single line functions, used for quick operations, without having to write fully function declaration


syntax:

lambda arguments: expression

e.g.

double = lambda x: x*2
print(double(23))


full_name = lambda first_name, last_name: first_name + " " + last_name

print(full_name("Lionel", "Messi"))
